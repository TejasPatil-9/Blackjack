## Introduction
Blackjack (formerly Black Jack) is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. The game is played with decks of 52 cards and is an American descendant of a global family of banking games known as Twenty-One. This family of card games also includes the British game of Pontoon and the European game.

Blackjack players do not compete against each other. The game is a comparing card game where each player competes against the dealer.Today, Blackjack is the one card game that can be found in every American gambling casino. As a popular home game, it is played with slightly different rules. In the casino version, the house is the dealer (a "permanent bank"). In casino play, the dealer remains standing, and the players are seated. The dealer is in charge of running all aspects of the game, from shuffling and dealing the cards to handling all bets. In the home game, all of the players have the opportunity to be the dealer (a "changing bank").
